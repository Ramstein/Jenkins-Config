Step 1: Update and Refresh Repository Lists
Open a terminal window, and enter the following:

sudo apt update

Step 2: Install Supporting Software
The software-properties-common package gives you better control over your package manager by letting you add PPA (Personal Package Archive) repositories. Install the supporting software with the command:

sudo apt install software-properties-common

install additional software for python
Step 3: Add Deadsnakes PPA
Deadsnakes is a PPA with newer releases than the default Ubuntu repositories. Add the PPA by entering the following:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

The system will prompt you to press enter to continue. Do so, and allow it to finish. Refresh the package lists again:

sudo apt update

Step 4: Install Python 3
Now you can start the installation of Python 3.8 with the command:

sudo apt install python3.8

Allow the process to complete and verify the Python version was installed sucessfully::

python --version
